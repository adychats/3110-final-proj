CS 3110 Final Project

The current goal is to build a simple (probably expandable in the future) IDE for OCaml, on Linux, supporting the following features :
- syntax highlighting
- find and replace
- compilation (just using ocamlc)
- commenting/uncommenting blocks of code using one/two keystrokes
- saving files with CTRL-S
- have file-browsing capabilities to search for and open files (optional)
